              <p>Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the
                global smart device market. Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products.
                Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around
                the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with
                knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned
                itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.</p>
